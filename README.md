# WiiUGamepadToMouse
This is just a simple application to be used together with a WiiU running UsendMii-Client:  
https://github.com/Crayon2000/UsendMii-Client  
Make sure to not have the UsendMii server already running on your PC when running this as you can only use one server at a time, this effectively replaces it.  
It will map out the gamepads touchscreen to the mouse position on your screen with adjustable overall size and offset.  
Also the mouse left click is mapped to ZL, ZR and A, the right click is mapped to L, R and B.  
Additionally you can map the left click to clicking on the touchscreen itself as well.  
The mouse scroll wheel is mapped to both left and right analog stick, scrolling faster or slower depending how far you hold.  
You can middle click by clicking in the left and right analog sticks.  
All settings are automatically saved, so next time you open it up you dont have to reconfigure anything.  
If the application you focus on makes the mouse unresponsive, then that application may be running as administrator.  
In that case, just boot up WiiUGamepadToMouse as admin by right clicking it and selecting "Run as administrator".
