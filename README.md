# WiiUGamepadToMouse
This is just a simple application to be used together with a WiiU running UsendMii-Client:  
https://github.com/Crayon2000/UsendMii-Client  
It will map out the gamepads touchscreen to the mouse position on your screen with adjustable overall size and offset.  
Also the mouse left click is mapped to ZL, ZR and A, the right click is mapped to L, R and B.  
Additionally you can map the left click to clicking on the touchscreen itself as well.  
All settings are automatically saved, so next time you open it up you dont have to reconfigure anything.
